## About Undernet

Undernet was created with the goal of simplifying the development experience by allowing the developer to write less CSS, as well as giving an easy JavaScript API for using common interactive UI patterns.

Undernet can both be a prototyping tool or the basis for your web app. You can easily pick and choose which elements and components to include, reducing the size of the overall bundle.

### Core Principles

- **Configuration:** The framework comes with a configuration file that you can update with your intended brand attributes, including colors, typography, the flex grid, forms, and more.
- **Semantics:** All examples recommend [semantic HTML](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/HTML/HTML5#Semantics), and always include accessibility considerations where necessary.
- **Modularity:** Undernet can act independently from your core stylesheet and can be added to to existing projects using [scopes](/docs/overview/branding).
- **Agility:** Installation options range from CDN to full pipeline control.

### Support

Undernet's CSS and JavaScript will work in _recent versions_ these browsers:

- Chrome ✓
- Firefox ✓
- Safari ✓
- Opera ✓

The framework is also tested in and supports Internet Explorer 11 and Edge on Windows.
